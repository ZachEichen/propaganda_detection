# Detecting Propaganda via Logical Fallacies in Political Speech

Logical fallacy detection is a task of significant importance in NLP, with applications to real world issues. 

In this project we aim to use transfer learning between the tasks of logical fallacy classification and propaganda detection, leading to a 20% improvement over conventional methods. 

Finally we apply these models to political speeches, to analyze the propaganda content of each.
