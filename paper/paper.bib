abstract = {Propaganda is a mechanism to influence public opinion, which is inherently present in extremely biased and fake news. Here, we propose a model to automatically assess the level of propagandistic content in an article based on different representations, from writing style and readability level to the presence of certain keywords. We experiment thoroughly with different variations of such a model on a new publicly available corpus, and we show that character n-grams and other style features outperform existing alternatives to identify propaganda based on word n-grams. Unlike previous work, we make sure that the test data comes from news sources that were unseen on training, thus penalizing learning algorithms that model the news sources used at training time as opposed to solving the actual task. We integrate our supervised model in a public website, which organizes recent articles covering the same event on the basis of their propagandistic contents. This allows users to quickly explore different perspectives of the same story, and it also enables investigative journalists to dig further into how different media use stories and propaganda to pursue their agenda.}

    abstract = "We present the results and the main findings of SemEval-2020 Task 11 on Detection of Propaganda Techniques in News Articles. The task featured two subtasks. Subtask SI is about Span Identification: given a plain-text document, spot the specific text fragments containing propaganda. Subtask TC is about Technique Classification: given a specific text fragment, in the context of a full document, determine the propaganda technique it uses, choosing from an inventory of 14 possible propaganda techniques. The task attracted a large number of participants: 250 teams signed up to participate and 44 made a submission on the test set. In this paper, we present the task, analyze the results, and discuss the system submissions and the methods they used. For both subtasks, the best systems used pre-trained Transformers and ensembles.",
